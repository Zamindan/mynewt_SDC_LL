/** @brief Notifies the nRF2220 software module about the temperature change of the nRF2220 device.

 * of nRF2220 needs an update, then this function returns @c false and no further processing
 * is needed. If it turns out as a result of the calculation that some registers need a update,
 * then this function reurns @c true. In this case you should call either
 * @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed_update_request or @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed_update_now
 * to transfer calculated registers into nrf2220. Which one to choose depends on
 * protocol in use.
 * You should call the function @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed_update_request function
 * if the protocol in use relies on the MPSL scheduler. 
 * You should call the @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed_update_now function
 * if the protocol in use does not rely on the MPSL scheduler.

 * @note The function is not re-entrant. Should be called from one context only.

 * This function is to be called when @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed returned @c true

 * This function uses asynchronous TWI writes provided through @ref mpsl_fem_twi_if_t interface.
 *
 * Prior calling this function you must:
 * - Acquire an exclusive access to the TWI peripheral.
 * - Ensure that the TWI IRQ priority is high enough so that any interrupts from the TWI do not
 *   get delayed. Consider boosting the TWI IRQ priority for the time of the operation.
 *
 * The function starts a procedure consisting of:
 * - request an MPSL timeslot
 * - when an MPSL timeslot is granted, it switches the nRF2220 into bypass state
 * - perform I2C writes to the nRF2220 to registers calculated by the recent
 *   call to @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed
 * - switch the nRF2220 back into standby state
 * - release the MPSL timeslot
 *
 * The end of the operation is notified by a call to the callback function
 * provided by @p p_callback pointer. The callback is called from low priority signalling context.
 * 
 * After calling this function with non-success result or after the @p p_callback is called you must:
 * - Restore previous TWI IRQ priority if has been boosted for the time of the operation.
 * - Release the exclusive access to the TWI peripheral.
 *
 * @sa @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed_update_now, @ref mpsl_fem_nrf2220_temperature_changed

 *                        The callback is called from low priority signalling context.
 *
 * @retval 0             In case of success, the @p p_callback. The @p p_callback will be called.
 * @retval -NRF_EINVAL   Nothing to write, the @p p_callback will not be called.
